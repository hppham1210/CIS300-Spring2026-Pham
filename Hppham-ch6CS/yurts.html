            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</p>

            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</p>
