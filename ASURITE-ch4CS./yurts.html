    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
        <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor,
            and a roof dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
        <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
        <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
            Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
            running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
        </dd>

        <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
        <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather
            with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense
            of adventure!
